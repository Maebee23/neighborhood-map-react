## About

This is the 7th and final project of Udacity's front-end nanodegree. Students are required to create a single page application from scratch using React, the Google Maps API, and a third party API of their choice. This application features state parks of Texas with the best night time viewing conditions based on Bortle Scale light pollution ratings. It features images of each park utilizing the Flickr API. The app also features details regarding the current visability conditions, courtesy of [Clear Dark Sky](#http://www.cleardarksky.com/).
